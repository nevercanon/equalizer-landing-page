## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned a lot by doing this challenge! This was the first one where I've made a layout for a tablet as well as for mobile and desktop, so I had a lot of fun with that and it makes me even prouder of the end result of this project. 

The background positioning was interesting in this challenge, so I got the chance to experiment more with using vw and vh as units of measurement for it. It was very useful practice for me.

The positioning and sizing of the orange section and the phone image for the different layouts was also a good challenge. I had to make multiple adjustments for each layout, but I think the end result looks pretty good.

The biggest thing I learned by doing this project was changing the color of SVGs on hover. I'd never done it before, so I looked it up and learned about the fill property in CSS as well as using SVGs as an element in HTML instead of using an img tag for them. However, when I did use the fill property, it only changed the color when I was hovering over the filled in areas of the SVG, which looked pretty bad. So I learned about using the filter CSS property as well, and that got me the result I wanted. It was a bit difficult to figure out, but I think I got the color to be pretty close to what the design asked for.

### Continued development

I want to keep working on larger layouts and making layouts for tablets, mobile, and desktop. I also want to continue practicing Grid and positioning, since I'm still having some trouble with those.

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://css-tricks.com/the-many-ways-to-change-an-svg-fill-on-hover-and-when-to-use-them/) - This article helped teach me about using CSS filters, and it also has an incredibly useful tool for generating the filter that you want. I've bookmarked it for future use.
